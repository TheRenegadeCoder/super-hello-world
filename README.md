# Super Hello World

Since working in industry, I've always been weirdly interested
in the idea of obfuscation. In a language like Python, obfuscation
is somewhat hard to do. After all, whitespace is forced and much
of the syntax is as close to pseudocode as possible. So, what do
you do?

Now, I've written a bit about obfuscation already. However, recently
I wrote an article about creative ways to implement Hello World which
got me thinking: how absurd of an implementation of Hello World could
we write? That's the challenge set out to tackle in this repo.

To keep things simple, I'm restricting the repo to one change per
pull request. That way, we can go back and see this beast transform
one pull request at a time.
